# Summary	and Intentions

> *“After all, is not one of the primary obligations of the historian to tell the truth about the past?” (Kelly, 320).*

For Module 3 I decided to create a Twine game, which is a text based game (similar to those choose your own adventure books that I read as a child) about Laura Secord. Laura Secord was an important woman during the War of 1812. This Twine game follows Laura Secord from the time that she helped her husband after his injury in the war to when she travelled 32KM to inform the British about the Americans plan to attack at Beaver Dams. Players can choose their own characters and decide which fate they will have by making choices. Ultimately, the end goal is to complete the “true” story of Laura Secord and her journey. I felt that this module was the most beneficial and **forward thinking** with regards to Digital History.

# Understanding Video Games and Digital History 

Using video games to explore a historical event, person or object is a way to engage players. In “Teaching History in an Age of Pervasive Computing: The Case for Games in the High School and Undergraduate Classroom” authors, Graham and Kee explain the importance of objects such as this, “Students interact with this technology less like a tool (something to get the job done) and more like a musical instrument (something with which to be creative).”(Kee, K, and S. Graham, 271). Thinking about the game that I created based on Laura Secord my intention was exactly this. I hoped to create a game that was exciting as well as educational. In the same article the authors discuss the problems with history based games, “The challenge for historians is that, with a few notable exceptions, history games are not created by researchers focused on learning; they are built by gamers obsessed with fun”(Kee, K, and S. Graham, 273). While creating this module I felt this struggle. I wanted to remain true to the facts but it was difficult because this story of Laura Secord offered minimal details on this journey. Although this provided room for creativity, I did not want to fill the game with so much fiction that it was unbelievable. It was difficult to find the correct balance (even if I felt as though I did achieve it). 

Another difficultly that I encountered, which is prominent in many historical video games is the idea of progress and a linear story. I picked Laura Secord based on my knowledge of the War of 1812 and the statue in which I used for module 1. Thus, when it came time to create the game I understood where I wanted the game to take me. Graham and Lee discuss this notion of games “Created by historians writing in the present moment and therefore occupied with present concerns,[6] and written in narrative form, our histories follow an artificially linear path, with a beginning, middle, and end” (Kee, K, and S. Graham, 272). This game is not a total active linear narrative (this is when the player can choose which path to take and ultimately affects their outcome). Although I have created a game where players can choose their characters and choose options, I have designed the game to ultimately follow one path and redirect the player back to that path if they veer off of it.
	
   Finally, one more difficulty that I had occurred to me while reading T. Mill Kelly’s piece about authenticity. This author suggests the idea “There’s no such thing as originality anyway, just authenticity” (Kelly, 310). This quote really stuck with me because that is entirely what my game was about. I was not creating a new story about Laura Secord nor was I retelling her story in a new way. Rather, I was taking the facts and spreading them out amongst characters. I was not being original because I did not make up this story but I was being authentic because I created a Twine game that had not been created before.
	
The importance of using video games to create digital history goes beyond the classroom. Understanding history in many ways is attributed to being able to understand the present. Thus, when we create accessible resources that allow a wider audience to be able to view, scan or play something from the present that represents the past, or something from the past itself, we are allowing for more people to learn in a new capacity. Although this is something as simple as a Twine game, I have been able to share with many people the history of Laura Secord and the story of a brave woman (who does not need a man!!). In a time as critical as this for important female leaders, Laura Secord can show not only Canadians but women every where that women were doing important things in the past too and that we can continue to do important things. This game is important because it combines humour and adaptability with bravery. And bravery is one quality that we as Canadians can all agree is a national trait. Laura Secord is an amazing woman and an amazing Canadian hero. I think her story is important and goes without saying, I will definitely be sharing this game beyond the classroom.

# The Practical Stuff

*Below I have listed some of the most important code that I used and essential guidelines for recreating the Twine based game.*

- Open [Webpage](http://twinery.org/)
- Use Application Online (top right)
- Click the green button that says “+Story”
- This allows you to create a new story
- Click the square box that is titled “Untitled Passage” (it as a green rocket to the left of the title)
- This is the box where your story will begin (the title page for your game if you will)
- Double click to open the passage
- At the top where it says “Untitled Passage” delete the text and label this **“Start”**
- Now below you can double click the passage to edit it 
- You can write whatever you wish for the first page of your game to say


	I wrote: 
 
		(font:"Limelight")[//It was a warm summer day and I was craving some ice cream...and chocolate. 
		I couldn't decide between Mint Chocolate Chip or Cookie Dough. 

		Forget it, I thought and I decided to refresh myself with some chocolate.

		[[Look for Chocolate]]//]




Now it is important to note **I CHANGED THE FONTS FOR THIS PASSAGE WHICH IS WHY IT STATS "(font:"Limelight")" IN THE CODE**
- We will worry about this after!!

- To add another passage (in order to connect this page to the next) you need to write down whatever you would like the text to say (i.e Continue, Next page, Go Onwards) and write it in between two square brackets like this: [[Go Onwards]]
- Close the box (it saves don’t worry) 
- Go to the bottom right hand corner and click play
- This will allow you to see what you have created
- Once you understand how to do this then that is the most important step and you can easily follow along
- For more information on how to change fonts, add links or delayed text please visit [Process Notes](https://github.com/trinaetmanskie/Module3/blob/master/ProcessNotes.md)

- Once you have created your final product click on the title of your Game at the bottom left hand corner and click **"Publish to File"**
- Open up the webpage: [Philome.la](http://philome.la/) and drag the file into the upload box. 
- Your game is now created and ready to go!
