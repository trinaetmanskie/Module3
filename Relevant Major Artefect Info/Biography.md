For Module 3 I wanted to create something that was more personal and informative about The War of 1812. The statue that I scanned and created in 3D for Module 1 was teh War of 1812 monument on Parliament Hill. For the second Module I decided to sonify the battle locations from the war. Thus, for the third module I wanted to move into a micro-history and discuss **Laura Secord**. She is an important woman in Canadian history. She repressents nationalism, bravery and courage. ALthough Canada was not Canada yet during this time she still remains a very important figure in Canadian history.
