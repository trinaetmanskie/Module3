# Process Notes

I started by brainstorming about what I wanted to make my game about. I knew I wanted to use Twine because it was the one that we looked at the most in class. As well, I am very creative (I think I am at least) when it comes to writing. I did google searches about the war of 1812 and women. Right away Laura Secord came up and I knew that I wanted to write about her. I enjoyed Laura Secord ice cream with my grandparents every Saturday so I figured it was time to learn some history about her.

I started by brainstorming and finding sources. I read several websites to learn about the background information of Laura Secord. A lot of the websites had different information about dates and specific details such as who Laura travelled with (her niece or alone), the day she left, who she talked to and where the Americans were going to attack. I looked through the sources to find the information that was the same across the most sources and then I began writing a timeline.

*My notes*
Important because it displays that the war is not just about “true Blue Canadians” (Canadian Encyclopedia)
Many versions of the story
She learned about a plan that the Americans were planning an attack on the British at Beaver Dams
On her own she set out to war FitzGibbon (32km walk)
No exact details of her journey but can be assumed that it was treacherous
Official reports did not mention Laura Secord but FitzGibbon wrote about it
Laura’s husband was a sergeant - he went missing after war and she went to search for him in the battlefield
1813
Americans requested dinner at Second household & Secord listened wisely to their planned attack on British outpost
Secords were loyal to the British - they knew they had to tell James FitzGibbon
DeCrew Household
War of 1812
Laura worried she would run into american guards so she took the long way
Chose to have her niece join her so it would be less suspicious
Following along Twelve Mile Creek
Elizabeth becomes exhausted and unable to continue
They came across Indian encampment
Explained her mission to the chief there and he took her to Fitzgibbon
She was very afraid because of their fierce appearance
The chief knew how important the message was
Victory for British because of this

I decided to use Harlowe for the style of my Twine story.

Very hard to use
I had no idea what I was doing in class
I know how to add a passage
Click Passage and title it “intro” and make sure the story starts here
To add another passage type words into [[TYPE TEXT HERE]] and then this will turn it blue and a new passage is added
In order to type into that passage, double click and keep adding
I spent two hours trying to change the fonts but google fonts wouldn’t work
I tried adding the code (from twin cookbook) into the passage box
Finally found the style guide (once you click your story name - bottom left, then the second or third from the top is the style guide) and you paste the text there
I did not know what to add in that spot
Finally figured out to add: 
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Limelight');
:: First
(font:”Limelight”)[First]

- had to add tag “first” in the *intro passage* (I don’t know if it made a difference but I tried)
- Lime light is the only font that would work for me.
- learned how to use italics (write words in-between //*slashes*// to make it italics)

- began by creating the starting introduction by setting the story of a child looking for chocolate to eat
- allowed the story to unfold as child eats chocolate and then create options of select characters

- I did not really document by process while creating the game because I followed the same mechanics. 
I only added the delayed text (here is the code) 
	
  {
   
   (live: 9s)[
       
	 (stop:)
     
	  [Words you want to appear delayed write them here
   	
 ]

}//]


- but the rest of the text was simply me creating new passages and finding ways to connect them

If I wanted to create a link to a passage without saying the passage name, all I had to do was 

[[NAME THAT WOULD APPEAR->THIS IS THE PASSAGE I WANTED]]

If I wanted to change the font in the passage

(font:“Limelight”)[This font would be the one that is changed]

I don’t know why other texts wouldn’t load but Limelight was great

***
- I played through the game after each chapter to make sure there were no errors. 
- It was difficult to be extremely precise (with coding that is important) but it turned out a lot better than I thought considering that I had no idea how to use it in class.

***

- I purposely made sure that only Laura Secord's was in first person and the rest was in second person. I thought that her story was the most imporant and was the central focus. I did want people to explore the other parts of the game which is why I encorporated the options to switch between characters at certain parts.
- I wanted to try and remain historically accurate but with the lacking of details I tried to also fill in the gaps to make it enjoyable for the player
- I hope that I can work on this game after and ultimately one day use it for my own resources for tutoring or eventually when I become a teacher on a similiar platform such as this
